Christmas Tree with flashing lights with a on/off switch - HTML/CSS/Javascript

I wanted to try and create a christmas tree with flashing lights that i would be able to turn on/off, just like a real christmas tree.

There is probably a better way to do some of the code but I wanted to make this on my own using my recently gained knowledge.

It works :D
